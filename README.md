### Hi, I am Charlie Martinez Dominguez ðŸ‘‹

- I am a senior at Cal State LA, graduating May 2024, 2024
- Currently diving deeper into Java / Python and web dev

Was roped into the STEM field since 8th grade with a Lego robotics competition. Failing a college programming course while in high school was further motivation to explore more. Being able to play my Space Invaders Python project and make it my own was the final push I needed to know this was for me. 

Now I am creating all the projects I am passionate about to further improve myself and leanrn everything I can. Currently looking for backend job opportunities so I can apply my skills and contribute to something larger.
